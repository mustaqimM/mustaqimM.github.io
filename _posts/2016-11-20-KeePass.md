What is KeePass?

KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your
passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database,
which is locked with one master key and/or a key file. So you only have to
remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole
database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption
algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish). For more information, see the
features page.

Download the official version from [here](http://keepass.info/download.html)

Make sure to verify it's integrity before installing by matching the provided
hash sums and pgp signatures.
