    -nd (no directories): download all files to the current directory
    -e robots.off: ignore robots.txt files, don't download robots.txt files
    -A png,jpg: accept only files with the extensions png or jpg
    -m (mirror): -r --timestamping --level inf --no-remove-listing
    -nc, --no-clobber: Skip download if files exist
